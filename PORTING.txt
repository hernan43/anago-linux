We don't have environment for Mac and Unix system. We welcome porting 
unagi/anago. Comments of sources are written in pseudo English and 
Japanese. Japanese charcter encoding is EUC-JP.

my build environment:
- MinGW 4.xx
- MSYS 1.0.011
- gcc, g++ 3.4.5 (mingw-vista special r3)
- LibUSB-Win32  0.1.12.2. 

Sources of unagi and anago are written in C99. A few of points depened 
with Windows API. Used Windows APIs are Sleep(), GetStdHandle() and 
SetConsoleCursorPosition().

Sleep():
It is used to wait idle status for tasks.

GetStdHandle() and SetConsoleCursorPosition():
They are used to render progress bars for cmd.exe.

To port another systems:
- Prepare C99 and C++ compliler.
- Prepare LibUSB.
- Remove #include <windows.h>.
- Alternate Sleep() for waiting.
- Remove GetStdHandle() and SetConsoleCursorPosition(). Use escape 
  sequence.
